"SPOILERS AHEAD PEOPLE!!Murphy's idea is very simple. He says if you want something, just embed the idea into your non-resistive (Subconscious) mind.To be honest,in the beginning of the book i did not find the whole idea very logical. It seemed like somebody is trying to sell some BS. But then a realization came upon me...He says""By embedding the idea into our sub-conscious we can get anything"". But, how???Now i feel i know how, as we force the idea into our mind we involuntarily start working towards it with our greatest capability using our full potential and thus we have achieved what seemed initially impossible to us.All in all, this book was really helpful to me(although i am nearly living the best years of my life). If it can help a person who is really satisfied with his life, i have no idea how many wonders it will do to those people life who want something really bad and need anything to help them with their goal.",1.0

I have no idea why people buy this one. I bought it reading the reviews. But this book is a waste of money. Only book I could never finish reading. The same thing is written chapter after chapter. Learn from the author how to stretch a one page idea to a 350+ page book. Also most of the incidences are too supernatural that they are coincidental and not scientific unlike what the book claims.I'm a book lover and this is the only book I regrer buying.,4.0

I read this book since the last 15 days every day at night before going to bed.now i feel i will be improved mently by this idea that is seen in the book . So I want to recommend the book that person who feel frustratd and depressed in one's life.,4.0
"It is just about self hypnosis or self suggestion, that too if you stretch it to sound more scientific. In reality, it is about miracles (literally) occurring with  self suggestion. Very irrational.. .. with self suggestion somebody gets the dress she wanted as a gift or a somebody who was alone gets into a relationship (here some psychological rationale can be attributed...)I thought the book would be some thing scientific, but it was more based on belief. So personally it was a let down. But even though, I am an atheist, I do not depreciate the power of belief on people who believe in these... Ultimately whatever keeps you in a positive frame of mind is good, if it doesn't infringe on others' peace of mind. This book in that aspect is good, gives people better than God to believe in... yourself, or the unknown self...If you want to know how these miracles can help or to know other people s experiences, this may be a very good book and might help you.But personally for me it is a two star...",1.0

"This book is such a scam. Dr. Murphy wrote this keeping in mind what his audience wanted to read about-hope, success and greatness. Sadly life is not a cakewalk. He created a bubble for the readers which actually does not exist. I find this very misleading and crooked.PS: if you suffer with anxiety/depression/ptsd or any other trauma or loss, i STRICTLY recommened you to NOT read this, its only going to make things worse for you.",2.0

"This book can also be called as Power of Your Subconscious Mind: The Universal TruthThis book is a Gem of a book and now I know why this book is in the top rated, best seller and most reviewed book of its time.According to me, this book is a milestone in human psychological development and in understanding the universal truth of why and how a person reacts to a particular situation.I am very much disappointed that I didn’t knew or read this book earlier in my life.The case study in book are awesome, the flow of the book awesome, the knowledge and the study material again awesome.I can talk and praise about this book non-stop, it is a must buy for each and every one of us since the psychological skill is a must to have.I could have paid 10 times more for this book and I am actually surprise it’s so cheap.If you find the review useful, consider clicking helpful!",5.0
"This book more likely keeps making claims without supporting it with substantial rational or scientific basis. Most of it is just stories about miracles, very disappointing since it’s a highly acclaimed book.

"After an extensive reading of this book i personally realised this book leads me to embark on the most wonderful journey  ever,which is the journey within.The Journey within provides solution to all our problems claimed by the author of this book (well known psychologist).He has provided simple cause and effect solution to each problem ( cause is thought and effect is solution). As he termed ""We are what we think all day long.""Joseph Murphy also mentioned that how new habits can be learned or unlearned which affects our daily lives and how thoughts  within controls us all.Personally, i feel this book can be life changing by applying principles of life provided in this book. Which are easy and simple.As Joseph said in this book ""everything is choice, choose life, choose love, choose happiness and the likes.And yes!

"This book had been sitting on my shelf for quite a while before I picked it up. It was originally recommended to me by my friend.Since I was on a book buying spree, and I was excited about delving into some new material at the time, The Power of Your Subconscious Mind was one among many books I ended up ordering. I’ve finally gotten around to reading it. Of course, it helps that I’ve been in the habit of reading one book per week for several months now.Summary: The Power of Your Subconscious Mind was written by a leading expert on the subject, Joseph Murphy. From my perspective, this book equates your subconscious mind with God, which is likely a different and challenging paradigm for same to accept.",5.0
"Think Positive Always, It helps you in being confident.This is the only Message, the book provides. Everything about all the chapters revolves around this only sentence.The book is full of examples and real life experience of the author, which is not at all inspiring. But boring.Yes I found it really boring to be honest.To describe a simple thing, the author has written 20 different chapters, which is really weird.I mean ""think positive"" has only one meaning, why to exaggerate it like anything?",1.0
"I have had read almost 60% of the book and have happy sweet memories with it.

"Its a great book!This book is basically a user manual of human mind. When we were born, we weren't giving an user manual to understand how to use the advanced machine, that is, our mind, given to us by god.I believe this book is the pathway to understanding the working of our brain and try to gain control over it by series of methods over a period of time which I think are very much effective to living a prosperous life.The thing which really strikes me is, we need to only send good positive thoughts like love, compassion, hope, joy, cooperation, happiness etc to our subconscious mind inorder to make the our way of living better! Its not as easy as it sounds, but we have to practice it from the day we start realizing this fact. And surely we can experience the change!",1.0
"Its one of the best book for ones self development and inner peace. When I started reading this I didn't felt that interesting but after some pages every word of it was great.The thing which I liked the most was that even though there is a lot of information imparted in the book it was easier to read because it is broken into many small sections making the book much easier to read.And specially the last page of the book where you will see the profitable pointers mentioned which helps in  understanding and remembering the important points.Overall it's the best book for self development, growth and mental peace. There is only one drawback that its lengthy in starting of the book but nonetheless a great book. Must read guys.",5.0

"I bought this book becuase, 1) I am starting to cultivate reading habit 2) it had highest rating.. But little did I do to dive in to the ratings..Yes, this turned out to be a worthy choice because of its concept.. But not how the author narrated it..Phew..! As one of the readers mentioned it to be highly exhaustive and repetitive.. It really is.. But good thing is author added the highlights at the end of each chapter and I read only that..If you are up for it.. Then there is a very good take away which I feel is true and I forgot.. Now, I started practicing it in my whole life and I feel great..It starts with a belief.",5.0
"I got a Kindle edition of this book. I read this book and applied each and every bit of writing in my real life and failed like a disaster. This book indeed has no reality with the real life. It speaks about thinking whatever I want and it will happen. Its just a common sense. If this would have been true then there is no need to study at all. Just by thinking that I will top the exam, we could have achieved it. I don't know why this common thing did not come up in mind while reading this book, otherwise I did not have to suffer that failure. Lowest rating is 1 so I have to give it.. otherwise, I don't think this book deserve even rating 1",5.0
"KNOW THAT YOU CAN REMAKE YOURSELF BY GIVING A NEW BLUEPRINT TO YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND""This book is special for me as i started my second innings of reading books from this. It was actually best start as there was need of positive thinking, positivity, motivation in life during that stressful lockdown period last year.In this book, Dr. Murphy combines spiritual wisdom and scientific research to explain how your subconscious mind influences every single aspect of one's life. Though we can't apply all the points in this books which are not practical and seems impossible for me, like we can cure any disease, grow extremely rich, by positive thinking,all these are, I don't think possible. But this book definitely helps us to think positive, feel positive, so we can get positive energy in our life. This book is must read for people who thinks they need some positive motivation to outcome from their disturbing lives.If you are beginner, want to start reading, I think this would be a great book to start.Let me know your opinion about this book if you have already read this. ❤",4.0
"I've read around 100 pages of this book and I am seriously considering whether to read it any further or not.Same thing repeated over and over and over and over and over again. The idea propounded in this book could have easily been discussed within 10 pages at max. But the author has reiterated the same thing innumerable times for 300 pages.Nothing scientific in the this book either. Its heavily dogmatic. Pseudo-religious (in glorifying one particular faith). While there may he merit to the central idea, but the methods explained to harvest the same are down-right foolish.I am surprised that this is an International Bestseller for so many years. You've got to have a non-thinking dead brain to accept what the author is indoctrinating through this book. It's completely unrealistic and impractical.",4.0
A good will never bore you and this book can't get you away from reading it.1. It's Handy and perfect size for quick read.2. Small topics to cover the big topics.3. If you have experienced that you have started understanding your mind then absolutely it's going to amaze you.,5.0

"I had several questions in my mind which were answered by the author through this book.

Same thing is repeated on every page of the book. The author stresses on only one part of the subject by citing numerous daily life examples which may seem somehow inauthentic at some point of the book.

"The power to achieve anything in the world lies within you and that is thinking about what you want with feeling and emotion repeatedly. This was the only conclusion which this book teaches us in every chapter and that is a kind of repetition through whole book.As we repeat that single thought it reflects in the way we see things , eventually it changes our actions towards that repeated thought. This actions become habits and habits are the key to achieve our goals.This book is the perfect guide to use our subconscious mind in different fields of our life.""A GOOD BOOK FOR A BETTER AND HAPPIER LIFE""",4.0
"It seems likes some wellness and positive thinking Mumbo jumbo. If all it required to cure cancer or bodily harm was a positive subconscious, then what is the use of modern medicine ?",1.0
"""The world you live in is largely dependent on whats going on in your mind"".A statement which describes what the book is all about. A must-read-for-all book written by Dr. Joseph Murphy.The book very aptly describes that what you want to have, how you want your the situation around you to be or for that matter how you want your life to be, depends on how your conscious mind communicates with your sub-conscious mind. Your subconscious mind is a treasure house within you, which does not argue but accepts what your conscious mind decrees.So in short, if your conscious mind communicates positive thoughts with your subconscious mind, then outcome will always be positive and vice versa.Some key takeaways from the book are as follows;1) your conscious mind is the ""watchman at the gate"". Its chief function is to protect your subconscious mind from false impressions. Choose to believe that something good can happen and its happening now. Your greatest power is your capacity to choose.2) what you write on the inside, you will experience on the outside. You have two sides to your life, objective and subjective, visible and invisible, thought and its manifestation.3) Belief is a thought in your subconscious mind. It means to accept something as true.4) what is popularly termed as faith healing, is the knowledge of the interaction of the conscious and subconscious mind.5) In the healing of the body it is, desirable to secure the concurrent faith of both the conscious and subconscious mind.6) Your subconscious speaks to you in intuitions, impulses, hunches, intimations,urges and ideas, and it is always telling you to rise, transcend,grow, advance, adventure and move forward to greater heights.7) Your subconscious is the builder of your body and is on the job 24 hrs a day. You interfere with its life-giving patterns by negative thinking.Its an interesting read and re-read for people who can understand and then practice to manifest the power of their own subconscious mind.",5.0

I am passing on this book to a friend who needs this, I urge anybody reading this review to read it, and suggest it to Ur friends and relatives as well. Afterall, ultimately all we are, is just a 'thought', so let's be the best one at that.. !",5.0
"There are 2 aspects of the book, let me try to explain these in my way.First Aspect: It is true that the mind has ability to control your body & emotion. Even in situation of utter pain one can find peacewhereas another can get depress in peace feeling lonely. Technically your mind has this ability, but now the question is how you control this ability and use it in the way you want…., and the answer is by ""Believe"".Once you start believing positively in something and you put all your efforts and focus to it there are far better chances of you achieving it in comparison to the person who is putting efforts but does not believe in achieving the goal.Let’s take an example of a competitive examination which is very difficult and only very few people can pass this examination. Now, there are two portions of the mind which author has named as conscious and sub-conscious. Your conscious mind works on logical reasoning and understand things in a very practical manner, your logical mind can see this as very difficult exam as only 2% of the people clears it, every year 2 lac people gets failed in this exam and like this all sorts of logical and practical approach is being used by mind to assess the success chances you have. On the other side you have sub-conscious mind which tells you that you can make it as you have blessing of your mother, God is on your side, your religious guru has also predicted the future and confirmed that you will make it. Ultimately your sub-conscious mind gives you enough confidence to put all your efforts and focus believing that this is your destiny and you will success.Eventually the person has more chances of clearing this exam if he uses his subconscious mind and hard work together. The author in this book has used various techniques for teaching how to program your subconscious mind so then you can artificially create this believe on, as and when required basis.But the key to access to subconscious mind is “true” believe (not just ordinary believe) and here comes the superstition in picture. There is a very fine line between true believe and superstition. And it’s very difficult to see this fine line and manage yourself to be part of non-superstition side while strengthening your believe. Like Keep fast, donate money, perform rituals, please religious gurus to strengthen yours believe in God but wait a minute…. Aren’t these all are superstition?Second Aspect: There are instances where author has referred to the law of attraction (from book secret of Rhonda) where he says that by only truly believing and using your subconscious mind without hard work you will be able to achieve something, and I totally disagree with this. If this would have been true than all sons of mothers would have become Bill Gates and all girls would beenmarried with the boys who had big time crush on these girls.There are two kinds of people in this world. One which likes the idea of his life being in the divine hand of God assuming that God will always do good for him and another who does not like the idea of his life being in somebody’s else hand and they are more comfortable with the idea of their life's control in their own hand, which type are you of?",4.0

The other day, much before even reading this book, before sleeping at sharp 10 pm, I had told myself very strongly that I need to wake up at 4 am by all means and I had checked my alarm too. The next day I woke up just 5min before 4...I checked the time since I was awake already. I was so surprised...I had woken up without an alarm and that too at the right time.

There are so many examples are there which we can completely relate to us..this book is not only for reading..this is a book for using..that's why I took a whole month to complete it.

How will the author explain that a person going paranoid by assuming one thing which never happened? His subconsciousness is obviously very strong to make it a reality, Why that thing never works?The end conclusion is in 2 words, not an alphabet more: Be PositiveHowever, our mind is a very powerful machine but the way this book is written is not the right way & I highly doubt a few incidents mentioned in this book! If you read it you will be stuck in a weird state of mind!If you don't believe it then you can try it, It's under rs100 only!!",5.0

"there are a few things in this book that i strongly disagree with, to be more precise, find it impossible to believe. This book gives various examples of people having unique experiences in their life which were handled by the power of their mind. Miracles do happen, totally agree with that, but generalizing it as something which will always happen and if it doesn't then you are doing it wrong is the main point that i don't agree with.But at the same time, if you are someone who has interest in psychological impacts that occur due to ones own thoughts then this is a pretty good book for you. It will give you a thorough insight on various experiences of people with different problems and the way they dealt with their problems.As i said earlier, there are a few things that you won't agree with but its worth a shot",4.0
"No complains with Amazon for their service in terms of the price, quality and delivery. However, the book itself is utterly disappointing. Right from the cover page, it starts building the hype that something amazing will be revealed, which will help one solve their problems. Once the core idea of the book is out, the rest of pages look meaningless. The author pulls some random (probably undocumented) examples to support his point. At times, he makes it sound like some magic. Please see the attached image for reference.I have earlier read similar books which inspired me and changed my outlook. This one didn't help at all. I feel it would have been better off as an essay than a book.",5.0
"Two stars for certain motivational lines and for good use of the language. But, the book is based on the mediocrity of a lay man's view. Nothing much given that can be backed either by science or philosophy. In the end, nothing good will come out after you finish this .",1.0

The language used is pretty lucid and the author engages you with his storytelling. The facts in it are true, those who believe in the law of attraction will understand the important role the subconscious mind has to play in it. Absolutely a must-have for all ages.",1.0
"This book gives some interesting insights about subconscious mind in its first few pages only.(If you are happy with it, then buy this book).After that, its full of repetitive... Blah.. Blaah... Usually I won't give pessimistic review about any books because I know how difficult process it is to write a book after years of research. I repect the author for delivered us this amazing research on subconscious mind. But the content in the book after 3rd chapters are useless bcz of the repetition of the same concept over & over again. Infact I quit reading this book after completing 5 chapter.

"It's a baseless theory, originated from the mind of author and has no practical scientific proof.

My personal opinion: This book dint not help me in any way. The whole book is series of the same story in different ways. Yes in life we have to think positively and proceed. But this book claims like we have to think positively and our subconscious mind will make it happen automatically even if it's moving mountains or curing diseases.No in reality things won't work that way. For everything might be work or health we need to take step. Nothing comes easy just by chanting and waiting for the magic to happen.,1.0
The very good book I have ever read. This book is powerhouse of postivity. Language is very easy even you can understand every word without translating on Google.

One of the best reads in self help(psychology ).Go for it without thinking and think with each line as you read. Compare your personal experiences with each line and you will come to know what you can or could have done for the situation or results to be better.Soul filling book.Teaches about the working of concious and subconcious mind.A must read forAll types of People in any field whether a lawyer or an engineer.It may give you better decision making abilities in your life if you practice the concepts given in the book CONSISTENTLY. If you are CONSISTENT then it can do miracles.Otherwise you are wise till you read the book and will forget to apply the principles once the book gets over.So be CONSISTENT in reading and applying.Many people do not know about the power within themselves to do things they can't even imagine.It all depends on the programming of their mind which they themselves do daily knowingly or unknowingly.,5.0

"I must say - A must read for believers in sub conscious mind and its strengths. Would say a quote from book -You are the sum total of your own thoughts. You can keep from entertaining negative thought and imagery. The way to get rid of darkness is with light; the way to overcome cold is with heat; the way to over-come the negative thought is to substitute the good thought. Affirm the good, and the bad will vanish.",2.0
"So it all starts with what the Subconscious Mind is all about, how it works, where your mind is the captain of your ship, your body is your environment and the Subconscious part takes order from the captain or the master of this ship.Now it's totally upto the one how and by which means to take order and to proceed with.You think with your conscious mind, & whatever you habitually think goes into your Subconscious Mind. Your Subconscious Mind accepts any suggestion, no matter if it's true or false and so is the different reaction to the same suggestion. What all matter is what suggestions you are taking up to? Your Subconscious has the answer to all problems. IF you suggest to your Subconscious prior to sleep, “I want to get up at 6 A.M.,” it will awaken you at that exact time.The day we are born, we are bombarded with the tons of negative thoughts/suggestions, whereas not knowing them how to counter them, we unconsciously accept them and so it lead us to those worst scenarios/circumstances.Your Subconscious is your book of life, so how you write it from the day one, matters all.Mental healing in the ancient vs the modern times, almost works the same, whereas the Law of life is belief what do you believe about yourself, life and the universe as ""It is done unto you as you believe""The vital step to success is to firstly find out what you love to do and then do it what you love. In that case, if you really don’t know what you really love to do, what you want to achieve, or how on earth do you find a field of effort that you will love so pray for guidance in this way,""The infinite intelligence of my Subconscious Mind reveals to me my true place in life.""Your Subconscious Mind never sleep or rest, it is always active, controlling all your vital forces. However the healing process takes place takes more rapidly while you are asleep.So trust your Subconscious Mind completely, know that its tendency is always life wards. It responds you in very vivid dreams.Diets, multivitamins and supports of all kinds will not keep these people young. They must realize that they grow old or remain young in accordance with their processes of thinking. Your subconscious mind is conditioned by your thoughts. If your thoughts are constantly on the beautiful, the Noble and the good, you will remain spiritually young regardless of your chronological years.A woman once asked Thomas Edison, the electrical wizard ""What is electricity""He replied ""Madame, electricity is, USE IT""So same applies to life as well.You cannot see your mind, but you know what have a mind. You cannot see a spirit, but you know you have the spirit of game. Likewise, the spirit of goodness, truth and beauty moving in your mind and heart are real.Believe in yourself & you can definitely do wonders.Feed your subconscious mind with the positivity, you're the only thinker of your universe & your thoughts are creative, & so creativity happens every time. Your subconscious mind is the builder of the body & can heal you.",5.0
"I had read this book many years ago and have actually applied the techniques given by Mr.Murphy this is no feel good book, this is actual working science, many good things that have happened to me in these 10 years like perfect job, money, relationship all came by using the principles mentioned in this book, one needs open mind, practice, persistence & patience to see the result and the book print quality is poor.",2.0

A good account of timeless spiritual wisdom. I learnt a good deal about the meaning of God and how a struggle can be self defeating.The author has included a number of prayers for specific outcome.

"The book by Dr Joseph Murphy, is about affirmative and positive thinking for achieving one’s goal. The key method highlighted is the visualization technique in which one assumes the end state or manifestation of desire as fulfilled. The following of the visualization technique on a regular basis especially before sleep and after wakeup in the morning helps to impregnate the subconscious mind with the thought, which then works to achive the same. Imagination and desire need to be congruent, and one needs to have faith in the power of prayer to get results. The context may change but the core principles or process remains same.",5.0
